    <!-- Reallocated Sectors Section -->
    <div class="help-section" id="reallocated-sectors">
        <h2>⚠️ Reallocated Sectors (SMART Attribute ID 5)</h2>

        <h3>What are Reallocated Sectors?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Reallocated sectors</strong> are bad sectors on your hard drive that the drive has detected and automatically
            remapped to spare sectors. This indicates <strong>physical damage</strong> to the disk platter.
        </p>

        <p>
            When a hard drive reads a sector and detects errors, it moves that sector's data to a reserved spare area
            and marks the bad sector as unusable. This is the drive's built-in self-repair mechanism, but it's a
            <strong>warning sign</strong> that the drive is deteriorating.
        </p>

        <h3>Severity Levels</h3>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-warning">WARNING</span>
            <strong>1-10 Reallocated Sectors</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Backup data immediately, monitor closely<br>
            <strong>Estimated Replacement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Conservative Mode: 3 months</li>
                <li>Aggressive Mode: 6 months</li>
            </ul>
            The drive has physical damage but may continue working. Some drives with a few reallocated sectors
            continue running for years, but the risk of failure is significantly elevated.
        </div>

        <div class="critical-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-critical">CRITICAL</span>
            <strong>>10 Reallocated Sectors</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Replace immediately<br>
            <strong>Estimated Replacement:</strong> Now (0 months)<br><br>
            The drive has extensive physical damage and is at high risk of imminent failure. Replace as soon as possible.
        </div>

        <h3>Why These Time Estimates?</h3>
        <p>
            The replacement estimates are based on research from <strong>Google's drive reliability study</strong>, which analyzed
            100,000+ drives in data centers. Their research found that SMART attribute 5 (Reallocated Sectors) is one of the
            <strong>strongest predictors of imminent drive failure</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to their data, <strong>ANY</strong> reallocated sectors significantly increase failure risk. The 3-month
            (conservative) or 6-month (aggressive) estimates provide a planning guideline for drives with 1-10 reallocated sectors.
        </p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong> These estimates are <em>probabilistic guidance</em>, not guarantees. Some drives with
            reallocated sectors continue working for years, while others fail quickly. The plugin uses conservative estimates
            to give you time to plan replacement during a maintenance window.
        </div>

        <h3>What Should You Do?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Back up your data immediately</strong> if you haven't already</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor the drive</strong> - if the reallocated sector count increases, failure is imminent</li>
            <li><strong>Plan to replace</strong> the drive within the estimated timeframe</li>
            <li><strong>Don't panic</strong> - drives don't always fail immediately, but planning is essential</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If you want a longer estimate, you can switch to "Aggressive Mode" in <a href="/Settings/DriveAgeSettings">DriveAge Settings</a>,
            which gives 6 months instead of 3 months for warning-level reallocations.

        <h3>Pending Sectors (SMART Attribute ID 197)</h3>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-critical">CRITICAL</span>
            <strong>ANY value > 0</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Replace ASAP<br><br>
            Pending sectors are waiting to be reallocated. The drive is actively failing and attempting to remap bad sectors.
            This indicates imminent failure risk.
        </div>

        <h3>Uncorrectable Sectors (SMART Attribute ID 198)</h3>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-critical">CRITICAL</span>
            <strong>ANY value > 0</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Replace immediately<br><br>
            Uncorrectable errors indicate permanent data loss. Sectors cannot be read or written, and data may already be lost.
            Replace the drive immediately and restore from backups.
        </div>

        <h3>Reported Uncorrectable Errors (SMART Attribute ID 187)</h3>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-warning">WARNING</span>
            <strong>ANY value > 0</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Monitor closely, plan replacement<br><br>
            Read errors during normal operation. The drive is having difficulty reading data but has not yet failed completely.
        </div>

        <h3>Command Timeout (SMART Attribute ID 188)</h3>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-warning">WARNING</span>

            <span class="severity-badge severity-critical">CRITICAL</span>
            <strong>>100 timeouts:</strong> Replace ASAP<br><br>
            Commands that timed out indicate communication failures between the drive and system. High timeout counts
            suggest the drive is becoming unresponsive.

            <strong>ANY value > 0</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Replace ASAP<br><br>
            NAND chip read/write errors indicate uncorrectable data errors. The SSD's reliability is compromised.

        <h3>Critical Warning Flag</h3>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-critical">CRITICAL</span>
            <strong>Active warning</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Check drive immediately<br><br>
            The drive has raised a vendor-specific critical warning flag. This could indicate temperature issues,
            spare capacity depletion, or other critical conditions.
        </div>

        <h3>Available Spare Below Threshold</h3>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-critical">CRITICAL</span>
            <strong>Spare < Threshold (typically 10%)</strong><br>
            <strong>Action:</strong> Replace within 1 month<br><br>
            The SSD has consumed most of its spare NAND blocks. When spare capacity is fully depleted, the drive will fail.
        </div>

        <h3>High Percentage Used</h3>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <span class="severity-badge severity-warning">WARNING</span>

        <h2>Conservative vs Aggressive Prediction Modes</h2>

        <p>
            DriveAge offers two prediction modes that affect how replacement estimates are calculated:
        </p>

        <h3>Conservative Mode (Default)</h3>
        <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Assume faster wear and shorter lifespan to be safe</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HDD SMART warnings: <strong>3 months</strong> replacement estimate</li>
            <li>NVMe write rate: <strong>30 TB/year</strong> (higher workload assumption)</li>
            <li>Target HDD age: <strong>6 years</strong> (10% AFR threshold)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Production systems, mission-critical data, risk-averse users</p>

        <h3>Aggressive Mode</h3>
        <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Assume slower wear and longer lifespan based on typical usage</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HDD SMART warnings: <strong>6 months</strong> replacement estimate</li>
            <li>NVMe write rate: <strong>15 TB/year</strong> (lower workload assumption)</li>
            <li>Target HDD age: <strong>8 years</strong> (higher AFR acceptable)</li>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <div class="help-section" id="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Q: My drive shows red/high risk but has been working fine for months. Is it really going to fail?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> Not necessarily. Red/high-risk categorization indicates <em>elevated probability</em> of failure,
            not certainty. Some drives run for years beyond their expected lifespan. However, the risk increases with age and
            SMART warnings, so planning proactive replacement is recommended.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Should I replace a drive immediately if it has reallocated sectors?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> For 1-10 reallocated sectors, you have time to plan (3-6 months depending on mode).
            Back up your data immediately and monitor the drive. If the count increases rapidly or exceeds 10, replace as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Why doesn't my NVMe drive show a replacement estimate?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> NVMe estimates require either: (1) Percentage Used data, (2) Data Units Written, or (3) Available Spare
            consumption. Very new drives with 0% wear may show "Unknown" until enough data is collected. This is normal.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Can I trust these predictions?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> DriveAge's predictions are based on industry research and real-world data from millions of drives.
            However, they are <em>probabilistic estimates</em>, not guarantees. Individual drives may vary. Always maintain backups
            of critical data regardless of predictions.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Why is my old drive showing as green/low risk?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> This was a bug in earlier versions! As of Build 21, drives with replacement estimates less than
            6 months are automatically upgraded to high risk (red) regardless of age. If you're seeing this, please update to the
            latest version.
